# hello-world

I am using Github as one of my portfolios to show my experience.

I have two years experience. The first year of programming I spent seriously struggling through C++. This is my second year. I learned html, Perl, css, Java, and Java-script. I had to learn Perl for my forensic computer examiner certificate. Perl seems to be really dated. I use Java as my core programming language but css is a lot of fun and addictive. Programming is my hobby and I hope to make it my job some day. I am having a lot of fun building projects. I started this GitHub profile to start sharing my projects.

I first tried to make a video game with C++ in my first year of programming and it didnâ€™t turn out well. I learned later on from other programmers that Python would have been a Better choice for a beginner. I went with Java since Java is every where and is the core language of Android.
